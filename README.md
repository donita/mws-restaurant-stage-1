# How to Use
Fork this respository and clone your local machine. Create a simple HTTP server using Python. Note: You do not need to know Python for this. Check your Python version before starting by running python -V from the terminal.

If using Python 2

spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
If using Python 3

spin up the server with python3 -m http.server 8000
Once the server is up and running, navigate to localhost:8000 to see the app
